# Auto-Complete Using a Trie (Sorted N-Ary Tree)

Overview
One common approach to implementing auto-complete functionality is by using a Trie (also called a prefix tree). A Trie is not a Binary Search Tree (BST) but rather an N-ary tree, where each node represents a letter and contains a sorted list of child nodes.

In this project, you will implement a Trie-based auto-complete system. The goal is to efficiently insert words into the Trie and predict possible words based on a given prefix.
